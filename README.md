📝 Note: 
1) At this stage, I’ve uploaded all my work in one place without organizing it yet. Some images used in the project might also be missing for now. Proper folder structure and resource management may not be able to do, since I am unable to easily use this platform. Sorry, for inconvience.
2) I humbly express that the frontend part remains incomplete because the health crisis going on diagnosed with clinical depression. All the related medical documents will be shown during the project evalaution. Thank you for your support.
